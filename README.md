# PIXOS!

## 2-Retro-style games in 1 repo!
* I was really bored at work so I created these games in the awesome Javascript game engine called PhaserJS!
* I might go back to build upon them in the future if I ever get bored at work again!
* Please do not judge my current coding style based on this repo;
because I started this 3 years ago while I was just starting to learn, have learned at least a few more things since then. ðŸ˜‰
